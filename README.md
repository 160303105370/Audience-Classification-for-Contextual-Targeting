# üì∞ Audience Classification for Contextual Targeting in Ad Inventory

This project implements a **real-time audience classification system** that tags news articles into standardized **IAB content categories** for **contextual ad targeting**.  
By combining **CNN-based text modeling**, **author metadata embeddings**, and **numeric features**, the solution balances accuracy with deployment efficiency.

## üìÇ Dataset

We use the **[Kaggle News Category Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset)**, which contains ~200k news headlines and short descriptions across multiple categories from HuffPost.

- **Fields:** `category`, `headline`, `short_description`, `authors`, `date`, `link`  
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Normalized category names and mapped them to **IAB taxonomy labels**.  
  - Tokenized text (`headline + short_description`) with a capped vocabulary.  
  - Encoded authors using hashing + embedding.  
  - Derived simple numeric features (publish time, text length, number of authors).

## üß† Model Architecture

- **Text branch:** Multi-kernel 1D CNN over token embeddings (captures n-gram patterns).  
- **Author branch:** Masked-average embeddings for multiple authors.  
- **Metadata branch:** Dense encoding of numeric features (year, month, weekday, text length, #authors).  
- **Fusion:** Concatenated text + author + metadata ‚Üí Dense layers ‚Üí Softmax output.

## üöÄ Key Results

- **Test accuracy:** ~78% across 20 IAB categories.  
- **Strong performance** on major classes (F1 ‚âà 0.85 for Politics, Hard News, Sports, Wellness).  
- **Competitive macro-F1** despite class imbalance (minor categories like Divorce, Weddings, Weird News).

## ‚ö° Deployment with TensorFlow Lite

- Converted the trained Keras model to **TFLite** with dynamic range quantization.  
- **Latency improvement:**  
  - Keras model (CPU): **116.98 ms/example**  
  - TFLite model (CPU): **1.90 ms/example**  
  - ‚Üí **98% latency reduction**  
- **Prediction parity:** 99.8% match rate (Keras vs. TFLite).  

This makes the model practical for **real-time contextual ad serving**, where millisecond-level inference matters.

## üìä Business Impact

- Enables **contextual targeting** in ad inventory, improving alignment between ads and content.  
- Boosts **direct deal effectiveness** by ensuring accurate tagging with IAB categories.  
- Deployable at **production scale** with low-latency inference, directly supporting programmatic advertising needs.
